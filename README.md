# Proximity Analysis of Linear Quadtree 
Linear quadtree analysis

This project analyzes the proximity difference between several linear methods of quadtree.
The methods under estimation are:
1. Hilbert Curve
2. N-Order Curve
3. ColumnWise Curve

I also wrote a paper about the testing results and that is also available [here].
